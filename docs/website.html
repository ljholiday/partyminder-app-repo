Party Minder is your personal concierge for unforgettable dinner parties. It's a lightweight, privacy-focused app that helps friends plan intimate gatherings with ease-coordinating dates, menus, invites, and shopping lists in one place. Starting with dinner parties, Party Minder will evolve into a full-featured social planning platform-supporting private events, shared shopping, recipe collaboration, and even optional grocery delivery. Designed for simplicity and trust, it's like a private network for people who still believe in good food and great company.
