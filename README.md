# 👋 Hi, I’m Lonn (aka LJHoliday)

I'm an indie founder, systems thinker, and creative technologist building tools that make life better—from meditation apps powered by motor sounds to smart stress trackers and sustainable marine tech. I believe in simplicity, connection, and designing for real people in the real world.

## 🛠 Current Projects

- **Party Minder** – A social-first platform for planning real-world gatherings. Think dinner parties, not dopamine traps.
- **Motorhead Meditation** – Mindfulness for gearheads. Meditation powered by truck stops and unmuffled V8s.
- **Break Minder** – A wearable app to monitor stress and remind you to breathe (before you break).
- **Dinghy Minder** – A solar-powered bilge pump system to protect unattended boats.

## 💡 Philosophy

- Build simple things that work.
- Design for life, not likes.
- Software should be modular, maintainable, and humane.

## 🌍 More

I live mobile—boats, vans, Airbnbs, whatever keeps me moving forward.  
Always hacking, always shipping.
